## 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

### Description
This repository contains a series of Python projects related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The projects are designed to help learners understand the fundamental concepts of OOP and gain practical experience in implementing classes and objects in Python.

### Project Details
- **Project Title**: Python OOP
- **By**: Guillaume
- **Weight**: 1
- **Start**: Feb 6, 2024 6:00 AM
- **End**: Feb 7, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: Feb 6, 2024 12:00 PM

### Background and Learning Objectives
The project is focused on introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Learners are expected to read and understand various resources related to OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, methods, and encapsulation. The primary objective is to encourage learners to experiment with OOP and gain practical insights into its implementation in Python.

### Tasks
The project includes the following tasks:
1. **My first square**: Define an empty class Square.
2. **Square with size**: Define a class Square with a private instance attribute size.
3. **Size validation**: Add validation to the size attribute in the Square class.
4. **Area of a square**: Add a method to calculate the area of the square in the Square class.
5. **Access and update private attribute**: Implement a getter and setter for the private size attribute in the Square class.
6. **Printing a square**: Add a method to print the square using the '#' character in the Square class.
7. **Coordinates of a square**: Extend the Square class to include a position attribute for printing the square at a specific position.

### Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **Shebang**: The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md**: A mandatory file at the root of the project folder
- **Code Style**: Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Executables**: All your files must be executable
- **Documentation**: All modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation using Python docstrings
